**COMOT** is a Python-based software tool designed to automate microbial cell counting and motility measurement through image processing and computer vision techniques. It is built using [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python) for processing and [customtkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) for the user interface. Currently, it supports `.mp4` and `.mov` file formats.

## **Usage**

1. **Load video:**
   - Open the application and load the video file you want to analyze using `Load Video` button.

2. **Masking uncounted area:**
   - Use the masking tool to exclude uncounted area due to protruding experimental probe or undesired regions, by clicking on the image area then click `masking` button when done.

3. **Main window:**
   - After masking, the main window will appear. Refer to the annotated image below for details about each component:
![Main Window Annotation](docs/comot_main_with_annotation.png)

4. **Proceed to analysis:**
   - Click the `Results` button.

5. **Set time range:**
   - Specify the start and end times for analysis (in second).
